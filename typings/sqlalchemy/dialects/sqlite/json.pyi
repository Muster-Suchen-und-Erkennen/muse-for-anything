    """SQLite JSON type.

    SQLite supports JSON as of version 3.9 through its JSON1_ extension. Note
    that JSON1_ is a
    `loadable extension <https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html>`_ and as such
    may not be available, or may require run-time loading.

    The :class:`_sqlite.JSON` type supports persistence of JSON values
    as well as the core index operations provided by :class:`_types.JSON`
    datatype, by adapting the operations to render the ``JSON_EXTRACT``
    function wrapped in the ``JSON_QUOTE`` function at the database level.
    Extracted values are quoted in order to ensure that the results are
    always JSON string values.
