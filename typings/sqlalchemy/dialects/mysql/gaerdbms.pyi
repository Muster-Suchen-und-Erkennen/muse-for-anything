.. dialect:: mysql+gaerdbms
    :name: Google Cloud SQL
    :dbapi: rdbms
    :connectstring: mysql+gaerdbms:///<dbname>?instance=<instancename>
    :url: https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/cloud-sql/developers-guide

    This dialect is based primarily on the :mod:`.mysql.mysqldb` dialect with
    minimal changes.

    .. deprecated:: 1.0 This dialect is **no longer necessary** for
        Google Cloud SQL; the MySQLdb dialect can be used directly.
        Cloud SQL now recommends creating connections via the
        mysql dialect using the URL format

        ``mysql+mysqldb://root@/<dbname>?unix_socket=/cloudsql/<projectid>:<instancename>``


Pooling
-------

Google App Engine connections appear to be randomly recycled,
so the dialect does not pool connections.  The :class:`.NullPool`
implementation is installed within the :class:`_engine.Engine` by
default.
