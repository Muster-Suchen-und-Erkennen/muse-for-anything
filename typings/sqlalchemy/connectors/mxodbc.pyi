Provide a SQLALchemy connector for the eGenix mxODBC commercial
Python adapter for ODBC. This is not a free product, but eGenix
provides SQLAlchemy with a license for use in continuous integration
testing.

This has been tested for use with mxODBC 3.1.2 on SQL Server 2005
and 2008, using the SQL Server Native driver. However, it is
possible for this to be used on other database platforms.

For more info on mxODBC, see http://www.egenix.com/
