"""Visitor/traversal interface and library functions.

SQLAlchemy schema and expression constructs rely on a Python-centric
version of the classic "visitor" pattern as the primary way in which
they apply functionality.  The most common use of this pattern
is statement compilation, where individual expression classes match
up to rendering methods that produce a string result.   Beyond this,
the visitor system is also used to inspect expressions for various
information and patterns, as well as for the purposes of applying
transformations to expressions.

Examples of how the visit system is used can be seen in the source code
of for example the ``sqlalchemy.sql.util`` and the ``sqlalchemy.sql.compiler``
modules.  Some background on clause adaption is also at
http://techspot.zzzeek.org/2008/01/23/expression-transformations/ .
