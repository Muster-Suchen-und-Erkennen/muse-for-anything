class ColumnAdapter(ClauseAdapter):

    Key aspects of ColumnAdapter include:

    * Expressions that are adapted are stored in a persistent
      .columns collection; so that an expression E adapted into
      an expression E1, will return the same object E1 when adapted
      a second time.   This is important in particular for things like
      Label objects that are anonymized, so that the ColumnAdapter can
      be used to present a consistent "adapted" view of things.

    * Exclusion of items from the persistent collection based on
      include/exclude rules, but also independent of hash identity.
      This because "annotated" items all have the same hash identity as their
      parent.

    * "wrapping" capability is added, so that the replacement of an expression
      E can proceed through a series of adapters.  This differs from the
      visitor's "chaining" feature in that the resulting object is passed
      through all replacing functions unconditionally, rather than stopping
      at the first one that returns non-None.

    * An adapt_required option, used by eager loading to indicate that
      We don't trust a result row column that is not translated.
      This is to prevent a column from being interpreted as that
      of the child row in a self-referential scenario, see
      inheritance/test_basic.py->EagerTargetingTest.test_adapt_stringency
