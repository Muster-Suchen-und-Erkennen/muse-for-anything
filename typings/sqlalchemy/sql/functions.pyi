        If "is_equal()" above is comparing "a" and "b" for equality, the

        Where above, the integer value "1" refers to the first argument of the
        "is_equal()" function and the integer value "2" refers to the second.

        This would create a :class:`.BinaryExpression` that is equivalent to::

            BinaryExpression("a", "b", operator=op.eq)

        However, at the SQL level it would still render as

        The ORM, when it loads a related object or collection, needs to be able
        to manipulate the "left" and "right" sides of the ON clause of a JOIN
        expression. The purpose of this method is to provide a SQL function
        construct that can also supply this information to the ORM, when used
        with the :paramref:`_orm.relationship.primaryjoin` parameter.
        The return
        value is a containment object called :class:`.FunctionAsBinary`.

        An ORM example is as follows::

            class Venue(Base):
                __tablename__ = 'venue'
                id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
                name = Column(String)

                descendants = relationship(
                    "Venue",
                    primaryjoin=func.instr(
                        remote(foreign(name)), name + "/"
                    ).as_comparison(1, 2) == 1,
                    viewonly=True,
                    order_by=name
                )

        Above, the "Venue" class can load descendant "Venue" objects by
        determining if the name of the parent Venue is contained within the
        start of the hypothetical descendant value's name, e.g. "parent1" would
        match up to "parent1/child1", but not to "parent2/child1".

        Possible use cases include the "materialized path" example given above,
        as well as making use of special SQL functions such as geometric
        functions to create join conditions.

        :param left_index: the integer 1-based index of the function argument
         that serves as the "left" side of the expression.
        :param right_index: the integer 1-based index of the function argument

    functions based on name-based attributes, e.g.::

    The returned object is an instance of :class:`.Function`, and  is a

        >>> print(select([func.count(table.c.id)]))
        SELECT count(sometable.id) FROM sometable

    Any name can be given to :data:`.func`. If the function name is unknown to
    SQLAlchemy, it will be rendered exactly as is. For common SQL functions
    which SQLAlchemy is aware of, the name may be interpreted as a *generic
    function* which will be compiled appropriately to the target database::

        >>> print(func.current_timestamp())
        CURRENT_TIMESTAMP

    To call functions which are present in dot-separated packages,
    specify them in the same manner::

        >>> print(func.stats.yield_curve(5, 10))
        stats.yield_curve(:yield_curve_1, :yield_curve_2)

    SQLAlchemy can be made aware of the return type of functions to enable
    type-specific lexical and result-based behavior. For example, to ensure
    that a string-based function returns a Unicode value and is similarly
    treated as a string in expressions, specify
    :class:`~sqlalchemy.types.Unicode` as the type:

        >>> print(func.my_string(u'hi', type_=Unicode) + ' ' +
        ...       func.my_string(u'there', type_=Unicode))
        my_string(:my_string_1) || :my_string_2 || my_string(:my_string_3)

    The object returned by a :data:`.func` call is usually an instance of
    :class:`.Function`.
    This object meets the "column" interface, including comparison and labeling
    functions.  The object can also be passed the :meth:`~.Connectable.execute`
    method of a :class:`_engine.Connection` or :class:`_engine.Engine`,
    where it will be
    wrapped inside of a SELECT statement first::

        print(connection.execute(func.current_timestamp()).scalar())

    In a few exception cases, the :data:`.func` accessor
    will redirect a name to a built-in expression such as :func:`.cast`
    or :func:`.extract`, as these names have well-known meaning
    but are not exactly the same as "functions" from a SQLAlchemy
    perspective.

    Functions which are interpreted as "generic" functions know how to
    calculate their return type automatically. For a listing of known generic
    functions, see :ref:`generic_functions`.

    .. note::

        The :data:`.func` construct has only limited support for calling
        standalone "stored procedures", especially those with special
        parameterization concerns.

        See the section :ref:`stored_procedures` for details on how to use
        the DBAPI-level ``callproc()`` method for fully traditional stored

    """Define a 'generic' function.

    A generic function is a pre-established :class:`.Function`
    class that is instantiated automatically when called
    by name from the :data:`.func` attribute.    Note that
    calling any name from :data:`.func` has the effect that
    a new :class:`.Function` instance is created automatically,
    given that name.  The primary use case for defining
    a :class:`.GenericFunction` class is so that a function
    of a particular name may be given a fixed return type.
    It can also include custom argument parsing schemes as well
    as additional methods.

    Subclasses of :class:`.GenericFunction` are automatically
    registered under the name of the class.  For
    example, a user-defined function ``as_utc()`` would
    be available immediately::

        from sqlalchemy.sql.functions import GenericFunction
        from sqlalchemy.types import DateTime

        class as_utc(GenericFunction):
            type = DateTime

        print(select([func.as_utc()]))

    User-defined generic functions can be organized into
    packages by specifying the "package" attribute when defining
    :class:`.GenericFunction`.   Third party libraries
    containing many functions may want to use this in order
    to avoid name conflicts with other systems.   For example,
    if our ``as_utc()`` function were part of a package
    "time"::

        class as_utc(GenericFunction):
            type = DateTime
            package = "time"

    The above function would be available from :data:`.func`
    using the package name ``time``::

        print(select([func.time.as_utc()]))

    A final option is to allow the function to be accessed
    from one name in :data:`.func` but to render as a different name.
    The ``identifier`` attribute will override the name used to
    access the function as loaded from :data:`.func`, but will retain
    the usage of ``name`` as the rendered name::

        class GeoBuffer(GenericFunction):
            type = Geometry
            package = "geo"
            name = "ST_Buffer"
            identifier = "buffer"

    The above function will render as follows::

        >>> print(func.geo.buffer())
        ST_Buffer()

    The name will be rendered as is, however without quoting unless the name
    contains special characters that require quoting.  To force quoting
    on or off for the name, use the :class:`.sqlalchemy.sql.quoted_name`
    construct::

        from sqlalchemy.sql import quoted_name

        class GeoBuffer(GenericFunction):
            type = Geometry
            package = "geo"
            name = quoted_name("ST_Buffer", True)
            identifier = "buffer"

    The above function will render as::

        >>> print(func.geo.buffer())
        "ST_Buffer"()

    .. versionadded:: 1.3.13  The :class:`.quoted_name` construct is now
       recognized for quoting when used with the "name" attribute of the
       object, so that quoting can be forced on or off for the function
