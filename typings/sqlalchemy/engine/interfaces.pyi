class Dialect(object):
    """Define the behavior of a specific database and DB-API combination.

    Any aspect of metadata definition, SQL query generation,
    execution, result-set handling, or anything else which varies
    between databases is defined under the general category of the
    Dialect.  The Dialect acts as a factory for other
    database-specific object implementations including
    ExecutionContext, Compiled, DefaultGenerator, and TypeEngine.

    .. note:: Third party dialects should not subclass :class:`.Dialect`
       directly.  Instead, subclass :class:`.default.DefaultDialect` or
       descendant class.

    All dialects include the following attributes.   There are many other
    attributes that may be supported as well:

    ``name``
      identifying name for the dialect from a DBAPI-neutral point of view
      (i.e. 'sqlite')

    ``driver``
      identifying name for the dialect's DBAPI

    ``positional``
      True if the paramstyle for this Dialect is positional.

    ``paramstyle``
      the paramstyle to be used (some DB-APIs support multiple
      paramstyles).

    ``encoding``
      type of encoding to use for unicode, usually defaults to
      'utf-8'.

    ``statement_compiler``
      a :class:`.Compiled` class used to compile SQL statements

    ``ddl_compiler``
      a :class:`.Compiled` class used to compile DDL statements

    ``server_version_info``
      a tuple containing a version number for the DB backend in use.
      This value is only available for supporting dialects, and is
      typically populated during the initial connection to the database.

    ``default_schema_name``
     the name of the default schema.  This value is only available for
     supporting dialects, and is typically populated during the
     initial connection to the database.

    ``execution_ctx_cls``
      a :class:`.ExecutionContext` class used to handle statement execution

    ``execute_sequence_format``
      either the 'tuple' or 'list' type, depending on what cursor.execute()
      accepts for the second argument (they vary).

    ``preparer``
      a :class:`~sqlalchemy.sql.compiler.IdentifierPreparer` class used to
      quote identifiers.

    ``supports_alter``
      ``True`` if the database supports ``ALTER TABLE`` - used only for
      generating foreign key constraints in certain circumstances

    ``max_identifier_length``
      The maximum length of identifier names.

    ``supports_sane_rowcount``
      Indicate whether the dialect properly implements rowcount for
      ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` statements.

    ``supports_sane_multi_rowcount``
      Indicate whether the dialect properly implements rowcount for
      ``UPDATE`` and ``DELETE`` statements when executed via
      executemany.

    ``preexecute_autoincrement_sequences``
      True if 'implicit' primary key functions must be executed separately
      in order to get their value.   This is currently oriented towards
      PostgreSQL.

    ``implicit_returning``
      use RETURNING or equivalent during INSERT execution in order to load
      newly generated primary keys and other column defaults in one execution,
      which are then available via inserted_primary_key.
      If an insert statement has returning() specified explicitly,
      the "implicit" functionality is not used and inserted_primary_key
      will not be available.

    ``colspecs``
      A dictionary of TypeEngine classes from sqlalchemy.types mapped
      to subclasses that are specific to the dialect class.  This
      dictionary is class-level only and is not accessed from the
      dialect instance itself.

    ``supports_default_values``
      Indicates if the construct ``INSERT INTO tablename DEFAULT
      VALUES`` is supported

    ``supports_sequences``
      Indicates if the dialect supports CREATE SEQUENCE or similar.

    ``sequences_optional``
      If True, indicates if the "optional" flag on the Sequence() construct
      should signal to not generate a CREATE SEQUENCE. Applies only to
      dialects that support sequences. Currently used only to allow PostgreSQL
      SERIAL to be used on a column that specifies Sequence() for usage on
      other backends.

    ``supports_native_enum``
      Indicates if the dialect supports a native ENUM construct.
      This will prevent types.Enum from generating a CHECK
      constraint when that type is used.

    ``supports_native_boolean``
      Indicates if the dialect supports a native boolean construct.
      This will prevent types.Boolean from generating a CHECK
      constraint when that type is used.

    ``dbapi_exception_translation_map``
       A dictionary of names that will contain as values the names of
       pep-249 exceptions ("IntegrityError", "OperationalError", etc)
       keyed to alternate class names, to support the case where a
       DBAPI has exception classes that aren't named as they are
       referred to (e.g. IntegrityError = MyException).   In the vast
       majority of cases this dictionary is empty.

        The callable should accept a single argument "conn" which is the
        DBAPI connection itself.  The inner callable has no

        also makes use of the :meth:`_events.PoolEvents.first_connect` method,
        will
        proceed after this hook has been called. This currently means the
        hook is in fact called twice for the very first  connection in which a

    The purpose of :class:`.CreateEnginePlugin` is to allow third-party
    systems to apply engine, pool and dialect level event listeners without
    the need for the target application to be modified; instead, the plugin
    names can be added to the database URL.  Target applications for
    :class:`.CreateEnginePlugin` include:

    * connection and SQL performance tools, e.g. which use events to track
      number of checkouts and/or time spent with statements

    * connectivity plugins such as proxies

    Plugins are registered using entry points in a similar way as that
    of dialects::

        entry_points={
            'sqlalchemy.plugins': [
                'myplugin = myapp.plugins:MyPlugin'
            ]

    A plugin that uses the above names would be invoked from a database
    URL as in::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test?plugin=myplugin")

    Alternatively, the :paramref:`.create_engine.plugins" argument may be
    passed as a list to :func:`_sa.create_engine`::

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/test",
          plugins=["myplugin"])

    .. versionadded:: 1.2.3  plugin names can also be specified
       to :func:`_sa.create_engine` as a list

    The ``plugin`` argument supports multiple instances, so that a URL
    may specify multiple plugins; they are loaded in the order stated
    in the URL::

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/"
          "test?plugin=plugin_one&plugin=plugin_twp&plugin=plugin_three")

    A plugin can receive additional arguments from the URL string as
    well as from the keyword arguments passed to :func:`_sa.create_engine`.
    The :class:`.URL` object and the keyword dictionary are passed to the
    constructor so that these arguments can be extracted from the url's
    :attr:`.URL.query` collection as well as from the dictionary::

        class MyPlugin(CreateEnginePlugin):
            def __init__(self, url, kwargs):
                self.my_argument_one = url.query.pop('my_argument_one')
                self.my_argument_two = url.query.pop('my_argument_two')
                self.my_argument_three = kwargs.pop('my_argument_three', None)

    Arguments like those illustrated above would be consumed from the
    following::

        from sqlalchemy import create_engine

        engine = create_engine(
          "mysql+pymysql://scott:tiger@localhost/"
          "test?plugin=myplugin&my_argument_one=foo&my_argument_two=bar",
          my_argument_three='bat')

    The URL and dictionary are used for subsequent setup of the engine
    as they are, so the plugin can modify their arguments in-place.
    Arguments that are only understood by the plugin should be popped
    or otherwise removed so that they aren't interpreted as erroneous
    arguments afterwards.

    When the engine creation process completes and produces the
    :class:`_engine.Engine` object, it is again passed to the plugin via the
    :meth:`.CreateEnginePlugin.engine_created` hook.  In this hook, additional
    changes can be made to the engine, most typically involving setup of
    events (e.g. those defined in :ref:`core_event_toplevel`).
