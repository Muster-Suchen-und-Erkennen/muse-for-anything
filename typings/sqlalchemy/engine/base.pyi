    The Connection object represents a single DBAPI connection checked out
    from the connection pool. In this state, the connection pool has no affect
    upon the connection, including its expiration or timeout state. For the
    connection pool to properly manage connections, connections should be
    returned to the connection pool (i.e. ``connection.close()``) whenever the

        :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`,
        and it will be stored in the
        ``_execution_options`` dictionary of the :class:`_engine.Connection`.
        It
        is suitable for usage by end-user schemes to communicate with
        event listeners, for example.

        The keywords that are currently recognized by SQLAlchemy itself
        include all those listed under :meth:`.Executable.execution_options`,
        as well as others that are specific to :class:`_engine.Connection`.

        :param autocommit: Available on: Connection, statement.
          When True, a COMMIT will be invoked after execution
          when executed in 'autocommit' mode, i.e. when an explicit
          transaction is not begun on the connection.   Note that this
          is **library level, not DBAPI level autocommit**.  The DBAPI
          connection will remain in a real transaction unless the
          "AUTOCOMMIT" isolation level is used.

          .. deprecated:: 1.4  The library-level "autocommit" feature is being
             removed in favor of database driver "autocommit" which is
             now widely available.  See the section :ref:`dbapi_autocommit`.

        :param compiled_cache: Available on: Connection.
          A dictionary where :class:`.Compiled` objects
          will be cached when the :class:`_engine.Connection`
          compiles a clause
          expression into a :class:`.Compiled` object.
          It is the user's responsibility to
          manage the size of this dictionary, which will have keys
          corresponding to the dialect, clause element, the column
          names within the VALUES or SET clause of an INSERT or UPDATE,
          as well as the "batch" mode for an INSERT or UPDATE statement.
          The format of this dictionary is not guaranteed to stay the
          same in future releases.

          Note that the ORM makes use of its own "compiled" caches for
          some operations, including flush operations.  The caching
          used by the ORM internally supersedes a cache dictionary
          specified here.

        :param isolation_level: Available on: :class:`_engine.Connection`.

          Set the transaction isolation level for the lifespan of this
          :class:`_engine.Connection` object.
          Valid values include those string
          values accepted by the :paramref:`_sa.create_engine.isolation_level`
          parameter passed to :func:`_sa.create_engine`.  These levels are
          semi-database specific; see individual dialect documentation for
          valid levels.

          The isolation level option applies the isolation level by emitting
          statements on the  DBAPI connection, and **necessarily affects the
          original Connection object overall**, not just the copy that is
          returned by the call to :meth:`_engine.Connection.execution_options`
          method.  The isolation level will remain at the given setting until
          the DBAPI connection itself is returned to the connection pool, i.e.
          the :meth:`_engine.Connection.close` method on the original
          :class:`_engine.Connection` is called,
          where  an event handler will emit
          additional statements on the DBAPI connection in order to revert the
          isolation level change.

          .. warning::  The ``isolation_level`` execution option should
             **not** be used when a transaction is already established, that
             is, the :meth:`_engine.Connection.begin`
             method or similar has been
             called.  A database cannot change the isolation level on a
             transaction in progress, and different DBAPIs and/or
             SQLAlchemy dialects may implicitly roll back or commit
             the transaction, or not affect the connection at all.

          .. note:: The ``isolation_level`` execution option is implicitly
             reset if the :class:`_engine.Connection` is invalidated, e.g. via
             the :meth:`_engine.Connection.invalidate` method, or if a
             disconnection error occurs.  The new connection produced after
             the invalidation will not have the isolation level re-applied
             to it automatically.

          Some DBAPIs such as psycopg2 and mysql-python consider
          percent signs as significant only when parameters are
          present; this option allows code to generate SQL
          containing percent signs (and possibly other characters)
          that is neutral regarding whether it's executed by the DBAPI
          or piped into a script that's later invoked by
          command line tools.

        :param stream_results: Available on: Connection, statement.
          Indicate to the dialect that results should be
          "streamed" and not pre-buffered, if possible.  This is a limitation
          of many DBAPIs.  The flag is currently understood only by the
          psycopg2, mysqldb and pymysql dialects.

        :param schema_translate_map: Available on: Connection, Engine.
          A dictionary mapping schema names to schema names, that will be
          applied to the :paramref:`_schema.Table.schema` element of each
          :class:`_schema.Table`
          encountered when SQL or DDL expression elements

                 1, "v1"
             )

         Note above, the usage of a question mark "?" or other
         symbol is contingent upon the "paramstyle" accepted by the DBAPI
         in use, which may be any of "qmark", "named", "pyformat", "format",
         "numeric".   See `pep-249 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/>`_
         for details on paramstyle.

         To execute a textual SQL statement which uses bound parameters in a
         DBAPI-agnostic way, use the :func:`_expression.text` construct.

          method will replace

        * Event listeners are "cascaded" - meaning, the new
          :class:`_engine.Engine`
          inherits the events of the parent, and new events can be associated

        The intent of the :meth:`_engine.Engine.execution_options` method is
        to implement "sharding" schemes where multiple :class:`_engine.Engine`
        objects refer to the same connection pool, but are differentiated
        by options that would be consumed by a custom event::

            primary_engine = create_engine("mysql://")
            shard1 = primary_engine.execution_options(shard_id="shard1")
            shard2 = primary_engine.execution_options(shard_id="shard2")

        Above, the ``shard1`` engine serves as a factory for
        :class:`_engine.Connection`
        objects that will contain the execution option
        ``shard_id=shard1``, and ``shard2`` will produce
        :class:`_engine.Connection`
        objects that contain the execution option ``shard_id=shard2``.

        An event handler can consume the above execution option to perform
        a schema switch or other operation, given a connection.  Below
        we emit a MySQL ``use`` statement to switch databases, at the same
        time keeping track of which database we've established using the
        :attr:`_engine.Connection.info` dictionary,
        which gives us a persistent
        storage space that follows the DBAPI connection::

        The returned object is a proxied version of the DBAPI
        connection object used by the underlying driver in use.
        The object will have all the same behavior as the real DBAPI
        connection, except that its ``close()`` method will result in the
        connection being returned to the pool, rather than being closed
        for real.

        This method provides direct DBAPI connection access for
        special situations when the API provided by
        :class:`_engine.Connection`
        is not needed.   When a :class:`_engine.Connection` object is already
        present, the DBAPI connection is available using
        the :attr:`_engine.Connection.connection` accessor.
